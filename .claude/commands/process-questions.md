# Process Questions Command (Deprecated)

**This command has been renamed to `/process-issues`.**

For backward compatibility, this command still works and redirects to the same workflow.

See `/process-issues` for full documentation.

## Quick Reference

Import and process responses from the Google Drive spreadsheet:

```bash
node scripts/import-responses.js

Then review each answered issue and apply changes.
